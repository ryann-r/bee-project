"""A list of pollinator garden tips."""

GARDEN_TIPS = [
    """Include plants with varying and overlapping bloom times, so that
    pollinators have resources throughout the growing season from spring
    to fall.""",

    """Shrubs and trees such as dogwood, blueberry, cherry, plum, willow,
    and poplar provide pollen or nectar (or both) early in the spring when
    food is scarce.""",

    """Choose flowers of a range of colors, shapes, and scents, to attract
    a wide variety of pollinators. Each type of pollinator is attracted to
    different plant and flower characteristics.""",

    """If you have limited space, you can plant flowers in containers on a
    patio, balcony, or in window boxes.""",

    """Hummingbirds are attracted to red, fuchsia, and purple tubular flowers.""",

    """Reduce or eliminate pesticide use. Neonicotinoid pesticides are
    associated with colony collapse disorder of bee hives.""",

    """Accept some damage on plants meant to provide habitat for butterfly
    and moth larvae.""",

    """Provide clean water for pollinators in a shallow dish or bowl, with
    half-submerged stones and sticks for perches.""",

    """Leave dead tree trunks, also called 'snags' in your landscape for
    wood-nesting bees and beetles.""",

    """Use plants native to your area, or at the very least, non-invasive
    to your area. Natives are adapted to the local climate and soil, and have
    evolutionarily mutualist relationships with local pollinators.""",

    """Plant the same species in sizable patches (3 sq feet+) to create a
    'target' for pollinators to find easily. In natural settings, plants occur
    in clusters.""",

    """Select a site that is removed from wind, has at least partial sun,
    and can provide water."""

    """Reduce mulch to allow patches of bare ground for ground-nesting bees
    to use.""",

    """If you must use pesticides, read and follow all label directions
    carefully, and use sparingly. Spray at night when bees and other
    pollinators are not active.""",

    """Favorite flower colors for bees are yellow, blue, and purple. Flowers
    that are pollinated by bees frequently possess specialized petals that act
    as a 'landing pad' where they can land while foraging.""",

    """Reduce or eliminate your lawn. Grass lawns are food deserts for
    pollinators.""",

    """Seek out a site that receives at least six hours of sun each day.""",

    """Butterflies are attracted to red, orange, and yellow flowers. They need
    to land before feeding so they usually prefer flat, open flowers.""",

    """Even organic pesticides can be potentially harmful to pollinators, and
    herbicides can wipe out some of their most important food plants.""",

    """Bushes, trees, and tall shrubbery are necessary to provide pollinators
    a place to rest, roost, and overnight. These don't necessarily need to be
    flowering plants.""",

    """Monarch butterflies roost every fall on pecan trees that offer no
    nectar, only protection from the elements.""",

    """Don't expect year-round tidiness. Pollinator and native gardens go
    through messy stages, that are important for various lifestage needs
    of pollinators.""",

    """Include herbs in your garden. Some herbs, such as dill and parsley,
    are the host plants for black swallowtail butterfly caterpillars. If
    you let herbs such as rosemary, lavender, basil and oregano bloom, they
    are wonderful nectar sources.""",

    """Avoid modern hybrid flowers, especially those with 'doubled' flowers.
    Often breeders eliminate pollen, nectar, and fragrants out of these
    blossoms, which are necessary for pollinators.""",

    """Create a damp salt lick for butterflies and bees. Create a damp area
    on soil with a dripping hose or irrigation line. Mix a small amount of sea
    (or table) salt or wood ashes into the mud.""",
    
    """You can build a bee house for nesting bees by drilling holes of varying
    diameter about 3 to 5 inches deep into a piece of scrap lumber mounted
    to a post or under eaves.""",

    """You can add nectar sources by providing a hummingbird feeder. To make
    artificial nectar, mix four parts water to one part white table sugar.
    Place something red on the feeder to attract hummingbirds.""",

    """Butterflies need food resources other than nectar. They are attracted
    to rotting fruits -- try putting out slices of overripe bananas, apples,
    and other fruits.""",

    """Hover flies feed on the same flowers preferred by bees, like sunflowers.""",

    """The invasive dog-strangling vine has a negative impact on Monarchs. The
    female butterflies mistakenly lay their eggs on it since it's in the milkweed
    family, rather than native milkweeds, causing their larvae to starve.""",

    """Leave dead leaves where they fall or rake them into your garden to provide
    overwintering habitat for butterflies.""",

    """Avoid tilling and mowing. Keep large patches of land undisturbed to provide
    secure nesting sites for ground-nesting bees.""",

    """Prune and deadhead flowers to encourage new growth and a longer flowering
    season.""",

    """Avoid seeds or plants treated with systemic insecticides. The plants absorb
    them as they grow, and the chemicals become distributed in the plant tissue, and
    are sometimes present in the pollen and nectar.""",

    """For smaller areas like gardens, seedlings and transplants are usually easier
    to use than seeds, and will bloom faster."""
