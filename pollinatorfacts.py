"""A list of facts about pollinators."""

POLLINATOR_FACTS = [
    """There are approximately 20,000 species of bees worldwide, and
    3,600 in the United States.""",

    """Bees can be organized into two groups based on their nesting lifestyle:
    solitary or social. About three-quarters of native bees in North America
    are solitary nest builders.""",

    """Most solitary bee species are non-aggressive and many are stingless.""",

    """Tomatoes, peppers, and cranberries require a special bee behavior
    called 'buzz pollination', in which the bumble bee grabs the flower in
    her jaws and vibrates her wings to dislodge pollen trapped in the
    flower's anthers.""",

    """Bees possess hairs that collect and transfer pollen grains from flower
    to flower.""",

    """Bees are the only pollinators, with the exception of a few wasp species,
    that intentionally bring pollen back to their nests for their offspring.""",

    """Bees exhibit behavior called 'flower constancy': they repeatedly visit
    one plant species on any given foraging trip.""",

    """A female bee may visit hundreds of flowers on a single foraging trip.""",

    """Native North American bees range in length from 1/12 inch to more than 1 inch.""",

    """Native North American bees vary in color: dark brown, black, red, metallic green
    and blue. Some have white, orange, yellow, or black stripes.""",

    """Approximately 70 percent of solitary native bees nest in the ground, digging
    tunnels in bare or sparsely vegetated well-drained soils.""",

    """A bee nest may be lined with waxy secretions, pieces of mud, or chewed up wood
    to protect the developing larvae from excess moisture, dryness, fungi, and disase.""",

    """Some solitary bee species (such as alkali bees) share a nesting site in large numbers.
    Some solitary species share a nest entrance but each female builds her own cells
    for their larvae.""",

    """A recent study shows 28 percent of bumble bees in the US, Canada, and Mexico
    are in the threatened conservation status category. The conservation status of most
    native bees is unknown.""",

    """Habitat loss, alteration, and fragmentation, pesticide use, climate change,
    and introduced diseases are contributing factors to the decline of bees.""",

    """According to NatureServe, 50 percent of leafcutter bee species and twenty-seven
    percent of mason bees are in the 'at risk' conservation status category.""",

    """There are more than 160,000 species of butterflies and moths in order Lepiodoptera,
    the fourth largest order of insects."""
    
    """Butterflies inhabit every terrestrial ecosystem -- from sea level to mountaintops,
    and from deserts to tropical rainforests.""",

    """Butterflies and moths need a host plant for their developing caterpillars
    and most adults need nectar from flowers to provide energy for flight
    and mating.""",

    """In the United States, 5 butterfly species have gone extinct since 1950,
    25 more are listed as endangered nation-wide, and 4 are listed as threatened.""",

    """NatureServe has assessed all 800 butterfly species in the United States
    and has found that 19 percent are currently at risk of extinction.""",

    """Most butterflies at risk of extinction are rare endemics: species that have
    a narrow geographical range or very specific habitat requirements.""",

    """Butterfly pollinators are threatened by habitat loss, climate change, disease,
    pesticides, and invasive plants. Local over-grazing and roadside mowing
    can also have negative consequences.""",

    """The beloved monarch butterfly is renowned for its long-distance seasonal
    migration and winter gatherings in Mexico and California.""",

    """In the 1990s hundreds of millions of monarch butterflies were observed; now
    only a fraction of the population remains -- a decline of 99 percent has been
    observed in coastal California since.""",

    """Pollination is when a pollen grain moves from the anther (male part) of
    a flower to the stigma (female part) of flowers of the same species.""",

    """Modes of pollination include self-pollination, wind and water
    pollination, or by vectors that move pollen within a single flower
    and from bloom to bloom.""",

    """Between 75 and 95 percent of all flowering plants on the planet
    require pollinators to reproduce.""",

    """Pollinators serve over 180,000 different plant species and more
    than 1200 crops.""",

    """Pollinators add 217 billion dollars to the global economy.""",

    """Honeybees alone are responsible for between 1.2 and 5.4 billion
    dollars in agricultural productivity in the US.""",

    """In addition to food, pollinators support healthy ecosystems that
    clean the air, stabilize soils, protect from severe weather, and
    support other wildlife.""",

    """Support local bees and beekeepers by buying locally produced
    honey.""",

    """Conserve all resources, use less, and reduce your environmental
    impact. Pollinators are dramatically affected by extremes of weather,
    and climate change puts pressure on native ranges.""",

    """Bees are attracted to sweet, flowery scents. This includes perfumes, shampoos,
    soap, lipstick, and other cosmetic products used by humans.""",

    """Moths and bats only come out at night, and are attracted to fragrant
    flowers.""",

    """Different bee species have varying tongue lengths. Long tongues fit long,
    tubular flowers like penstemons, and short tongues fit short-tubed flowers
    like sunflowers.""",

    """Bumble bees groom pollen from their body hairs into 'pollen baskets' on
    their legs for transport to the nest.""",

    """Just 250 mason bees can pollinate an acre of apple trees. It would take
    10,000-250,000 honey bees to do the same work."""
