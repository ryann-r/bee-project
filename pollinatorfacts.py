POLLINATOR_FACTS = [
    """There are approximately 20,000 species of bees worldwide, and
    3,600 in the United States.""",

    """More than 90 percent of bee species live solitary lives, in which each
    female builds her own nest alone.""",

    """Most solitary bee species are non-aggressive and many are stingless.""",

    """Bees possess hairs that collect and transfer pollen grains from flower
    to flower.""",

    """Bees are the only pollinators, with the exception of a few wasp species,
    that intentionally bring pollen back to their nests for their offspring.""",

    """Bees exhibit behavior called 'flower constancy': they repeatedly visit
    one plant species on any given foraging trip.""",

    """A female bee may visit hundreds of flowers on a single foraging trip.""",

    """Native North American bees range in length from 1/12 inch to more than 1 inch.""",

    """Native North American bees vary in color: dark brown, black, red, metallic green
    and blue. Some have white, orange, yellow, or black stripes.""",

    """Approximately 70 percent of solitary native bees nest in the ground, digging
    tunnels in bare or sparsely vegetated well-drained soils.""",

    """A bee nest may be lined with waxy secretions, pieces of mud, or chewed up wood
    to protect the developing larvae from excess moisture, dryness, fungi, and disase.""",

    """Some solitary bee species (such as alkali bees) share a nesting site in large numbers.
    Some solitary species share a nest entrance but each female builds her own cells
    for their larvae.""",

    """A recent study shows 28 percent of bumble bees in the US, Canada, and Mexico
    are in the threatened conservation status category. The conservation status of most
    native bees is unknown.""",

    """Habitat loss, alteration, and fragmentation, pesticide use, climate change,
    and introduced diseases are contributing factors to the decline of bees.""",

    """According to NatureServe, 50 percent of leafcutter bee species and twenty-seven
    percent of mason bees are in the 'at risk' conservation status category.""",

    """There are more than 160,000 species of butterflies and moths in order Lepiodoptera,
    the fourth largest order of insects."""
    
    """Butterflies inhabit every terrestrial ecosystem -- from sea level to mountaintops,
    and from deserts to tropical rainforests.""",

    """Butterflies and moths need a host plant for their developing caterpillars
    and most adults need nectar from flowers to provide energy for flight
    and mating.""",

    """In the United States, 5 butterfly species have gone extinct since 1950,
    25 more are listed as endangered nation-wide, and 4 are listed as threatened.""",

    """NatureServe has assessed all 800 butterfly species in the United States
    and has found that 19 percent are currently at risk of extinction.""",

    """Most butterflies at risk of extinction are rare endemics: species that have
    a narrow geographical range or very specific habitat requirements.""",

    """Butterfly pollinators are threatened by habitat loss, climate change, disease,
    pesticides, and invasive plants. Local over-grazing and roadside mowing
    can also have negative consequences.""",

    """The beloved monarch butterfly is renowned for its long-distance seasonal
    migration and winter gatherings in Mexico and California.""",

    """In the 1990s hundreds of millions of monarch butterflies were observed; now
    only a fraction of the population remains -- a decline of 99 percent has been
    observed in coastal California since.""",
